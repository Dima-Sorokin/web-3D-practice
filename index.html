      in the woods on her own time.<br /> "I will be a professional player," <br />she writes,<br /> and I think this is
      exactly why it's
      so<br />
      terrifying when you learn that sport<br /> as an entire community<br /> seems to have no understanding of<br /> or
      interest for
      women
      at all.<br /><br /><br />
      "It takes me back to years ago."<br /> If there was ever a case about how feminism can coexist with
      misogyny,<br /> Serena
      Williams' recent press conference<br /> would make sure any male players who might do wrong were shamed<br /> into
      keeping
      their
      mouths shut instead:

    <br /><br /><br />

      unicorn wants to play frisbee,<br /> but you've already done your best,"<br />
      her father said.<br /> Crowley was in high school<br /> when the shooting happened <br />on Nov 18,
      2012<br /> at a mall called Target<br /> in Aurora<br /> that left 12 people dead and another 21 wounded.<br />
      "My dad would have gone into hiding<br /> if it wasn't for his mom's help,<br />" he said of those who were never
      convicted<br /> or
      punished for their actions.<br /> Although Crowler has been out of prison since May 2014,<br /> getting jobs is
      difficult<br />
      because so many ex-cons live here as well<br /> - among them are some young men now serving time after being
      released<br />
      from
      state prisons following recent convictions over firearms charges.<br /> As par<br /><br /><br />

      This is important to remember. Love isn't like pie.<br /> You don't need to divide it among all your friends and loved
      ones.<br /> No matter how much love you give, you can always give more.<br /> It doesn't run out, so don't try to hold back
      giving it as if it may one day run out. <br />Give it freely and as much as you want.<br /><br /><br />

      I haven't bailed on writing.<br /> Look, I'm generating a random paragraph at this very moment in an attempt to get my
      writing back on track. I am making an effort.<br /> I will start writing consistently again!<br /><br /><br />

      She didn't understand how changed worked.<br /> When she looked at today compared to yesterday,<br /> there was nothing that
      she could see that was different.<br /> Yet, when she looked at today compared to last year,<br /> she couldn't see how
      anything was ever the same.<br /><br /><br />

      I'm meant to be writing at this moment.<br /> What I mean is, I'm meant to be writing something else at this moment. <br />The
      document I'm meant to be writing is, <br />of course, open in another program on my computer and is patiently awaiting
      my attention.<br /> Yet here I am plonking down senseless sentiments in this paragraph because it's easier to do than to
      work on anything particularly meaningful. <br />I am grateful for the distraction.<br /><br /><br />

      Her mom had warned her.<br /> She had been warned time and again,<br /> but she had refused to believe her. <br />She had done
      everything right and she knew she would be rewarded for doing so with the promotion.<br /> So when the promotion was
      given to her main rival,<br /> it not only stung, it threw her belief system into disarray.<br /> It was her first big lesson
      in life, but not the last.<br /><br /><br />

      He sat across from her trying to imagine it was the first time.<br /> It wasn't. Had it been a hundred? <br />It quite
      possibly could have been.<br /> Two hundred? Probably not. His mind wandered until he caught himself and again tried to
      imagine it was the first time.<br /><br /><br />

      I'm heading back to Colorado tomorrow after being down in Santa Barbara over the weekend for the festival there.<br /> I
      will be making October plans once there and will try to arrange so I'm back here for the birthday if possible.<br />
      I'll let you know as soon as I know the doctor's appointment schedule and my flight plans.<br /><br /><br />
